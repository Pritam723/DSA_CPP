// Leetcode 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences
// https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/


/*
Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique, or false otherwise.

Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
*/

/* We can use 2 hasmaps to solve the problem 
Or, use brute force.
Will do later after we learn hashmaps.
